In mm/dd/yyyy format, the start of the lock-up period would be the same as the date of the prospectus, but since that information is not provided, we cannot determine the exact start date. However, we can identify the end of the lockup period:

• Upon expiration of the lock-up agreements and market stand-off provisions described below, following the date that is 180 days after the date of this prospectus.

06/29/2023"
