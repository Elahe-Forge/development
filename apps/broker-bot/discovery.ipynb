(“Forge”) serves the complex and emerging needs of the private market ecosystem by forging new connections through our technology, data and expertise. \\n\\nFounded in 2014, Forge empowers investors and shareholders by facilitating liquidity in the private markets.\\n\\nSecurities related services are offered through Forge Securities LLC, a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and wholly owned subsidiary of Forge. \\n\\nForge Securities operates an alternative trading system for trading of restricted securities. Forge Securities offers brokerage services by acting as your agent in buying or selling unregistered non-public company securities, which include preferred and common stock, structured investments, and membership interests in affiliated and unaffiliated private fund interests. We also act as placement agent for issuers in direct private company securities offerings to investors.\\n\\nForge's secondary market platform gives institutional investors access to buying and selling opportunities outside of primary funding rounds, tender offers, and exit events.\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic Market vs Private Market\\n\\nThe ‘public market’ refers to investing in issuers (companies) that are publicly traded on a national exchange such as Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\nPublic companies’ shares are typically available for trading to the general public.\\n\\nCompanies traded in the public market must adhere to financial and performance disclosure requirements and as a result information is more readily available.\\n\\nInvestors trading in company shares in the public market do not need to meet any minimum financial threshold or level of investment sophistication.\\n\\nWhen buying or selling, the time between executing a trade to settlement (receiving funds or securities) is typically trade date plus one day. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe ‘private market’ refers to investing in companies that are not publicly traded, or in other words private companies.\\n\\nPrivate companies do not need to disclose financial and performance information, and information about the company may be more difficult to find.• Investors trading in the private market must typically be, at minimum, an “accredited investor.”\\n\\nWhen buying or selling a private company, the time between executing a trade to settlement (receiving funds or securities) could extend up to several months.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccredited Investor\\n\\nAn “accredited investor” is defined in Rule 501 of the SEC Regulation D, and in the context of a natural person, includes anyone who:\\n\\nEarned income that exceeded $200,000, or $300,000 together with a spouse, in each of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the same for the current year, or\\n\\nHas a net worth over $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse (excluding the value of their primary residence), or\\n\\nIndividuals who have certain professional certifications, designations or credentials, or Individuals who are “knowledgeable employees” as defined in Rule 3c-5(a)(4) under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\\n\\n\\n\\nRisks Inherent in the Private Markets\\n\\nInvesting in private company securities is not suitable for all investors.\\n\\nAn investment in private company securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk.\\n\\nIt should only be considered as a long-term investment.\\n\\nYou must be prepared to withstand a total loss of your investment.\\n\\nPrivate company securities are also highly illiquid and there is no guarantee that a market will develop for such securities.\\n\\nSecurities laws generally prohibits the resale of restricted securities without an available exemption from registration which limits a holder’s ability to resale his or her private securities quickly. Such securities also may be subject to restrictions placed by the issuer in order to resale the securities.\\n\\nEach investment also carries its own specific risks, and you should complete your own independent due diligence regarding the investment, including obtaining additional information about the company, opinions, financial projections and legal or other investment advice. Information about private companies including its financials can also be limited and not readily available, as distinguished from public companies.\\n\\nAccordingly, investing in private company securities is appropriate only for those sophisticated investors who can also tolerate a high degree of risk and do not require a liquid investment.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4505, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8418712251686359), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='38b59fdc-6414-4195-8372-647ec89f9bef', embedding=None, metadata={'file_name': 'faq_document.docx', 'file_path': '/Users/bobrandt/workspaces/broker_bot_dev/data/faq_document.docx', 'file_type': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'file_size': 23825, 'creation_date': '2024-09-26', 'last_modified_date': '2024-09-26'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c7c3c212-2782-46b7-8316-225fc7334f79', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'file_name': 'faq_document.docx', 'file_path': '/Users/bobrandt/workspaces/broker_bot_dev/data/faq_document.docx', 'file_type': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'file_size': 23825, 'creation_date': '2024-09-26', 'last_modified_date': '2024-09-26'}, hash='d2bf8f9549a3ef8449cf0ad908a83a68946ca7700787bece0d4089e285010481'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='6cbcdc3b-48ac-47ee-a67c-55efa2090235', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'file_name': 'faq_document.docx', 'file_path': '/Users/bobrandt/workspaces/broker_bot_dev/data/faq_document.docx', 'file_type': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'file_size': 23825, 'creation_date': '2024-09-26', 'last_modified_date': '2024-09-26'}, hash='fbae7e7f3559b19d4c71e2b3f1b72516926bf7a70d549e25d3582333faf3b86d')}, text=\"The Forge Platform\\n\\nData and Analysis Tools.
