The public marks tab contains all publicly reported marks collected and processed by Forge Data. Public Marks are filed on a monthly/quarterly cadence by mutual funds in federally required reportings, either N-PORT or N-CSR.

Collection & Methodology
Forge Data leverages web scraping and RPA to extract N-PORT and N-CSRs from the SEC EDGAR website, identify private company holdings within those documents, and calculate the FMV/Share derived for each Mutual Fund position. That data is then batch uploaded to and made available here, as defined below.
