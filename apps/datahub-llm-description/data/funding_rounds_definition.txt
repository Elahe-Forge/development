Notes
While the majority of companies are incorporated in Delaware, this is not always the case. For companies that are domiciled internationally, these documents are not available, and thus we cannot provide cap table information.
The data shown is generated from what is represented on company's latest identified Certificate of Incorporation. As such, there may be instances (e.g. re-capitalizations) where the information shown does not fully represent all equity types that have existed historically for any given company.
This authorization is not a requirement to sell said shares, and the company may choose to sell a portion or none
