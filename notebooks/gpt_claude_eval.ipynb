Photo / Peter de Graaf Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson has returned to his Kerikeri roots to set up a world-leading business developing autonomous aircraft — in other words, robot planes. Photo / Peter de Graaf A dream of opening up career opportunities for Northland youth that didn’t exist when he left school has inspired a Kerikeri man to come home and set up a world-leading business developing robot planes. Merlin Labs NZ, the first overseas subsidiary of US aviation technology firm Merlin Labs, opened its brand-new base next to Bay of Islands Airport in Kerikeri on Friday. Shaun Johnson, who joined the Air Force straight out of seventh form at Kerikeri High School, has returned to his old hometown to lead the ground-breaking venture. It would start small as an air freight operation using conventional human-piloted planes and gradually transition to autonomous aircraft which were able to take off, fly and land by themselves. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. In the future the same technology could be applied to reduce crews on bigger planes, he said. In Kerikeri, the firm’s first steps would be to integrate its software and hardware into a fleet of Cessna Caravan planes and to work with New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to certify its systems and make them air-legal. Johnson said the firm would start flying freight in June with an unmodified aircraft between Northland, Auckland and Palmerston North. “We want to demonstrate to the regulator and the public that we’re a capable and reliable freight company before we start introducing new technology. And for ourselves, it’s to get our pilots familiar with the routes we’re going to fly and the avionics in the aircraft because that doesn’t change. We’ll do that for a good year and then start to add our advanced technology as it’s certified,” he said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. At the same time, the company would be carrying out compliance flight testing with the CAA. The goal was to start automated takeoff-to-touchdown flights from the start of 2025, albeit with a human pilot as a backup to make sure everything was functioning as it was supposed to. Ngāti Rēhia’s Kipa Munro offers a blessing while Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson and Merlin Labs chief of staff Dan Rickert place their hands on the company’s soon-to-be autonomous aircraft. Photo / Peter de Graaf There was no timeline as yet for flying without a human pilot on board. “It would be naive to think that all the questions have been answered yet,” he said. “The immediate goals for us are proving our technology in the Caravan, then adding some of those features — which actually are enhancements to safety — to bigger aircraft and growing a deeper understanding of what it means to go from two crew to one and then eventually from one to zero. So New Zealand will become a real test bed for what we do in the future.” Merlin wasn’t the only company developing robot planes but its system was unique in that it could not only take off, join an instrument-flight-rules route and land at the other end, it could also respond to voice commands from air traffic control. Johnson said he didn’t choose Kerikeri only because it was where he grew up. “Honestly, I did look all over the country, and this offers some unique airspace for testing. We’ve got pretty unrestricted airspace up to high altitudes and we have incredible airports with instrument-flight-rules approaches, which we need for our system. We can go between Kerikeri and Kaitāia or Kerikeri and Whangārei in relatively uncongested airspace, and once our product is certified we can head down to Auckland and test our systems in a really congested environment.” The Far North also had the advantages of a supportive council and community, and opportunities to pick up freight runs that wouldn’t interfere with other operators.

The last time he was in the Advocate was when he landed an Iroquois chopper on the field at his old school. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Later he became an engineering officer, completed some tertiary education, and retired as a Wing Commander. He then joined the CAA for six years before he was shoulder-tapped by Merlin to set up the company’s first overseas subsidiary. New Zealand was chosen because of the strong relationship between the CAA and the US Federal Aviation Administration, plus the CAA’s reputation for “being pragmatic, forward-looking yet grounded in safety”. So far Merlin Labs NZ had 15 staff, seven of whom were permanently in Kerikeri. Its second Cessna Caravan arrived yesterday and a third is due late next year. Renata Tane sounds a pūkaea during the blessing of Merlin NZ’s newly delivered Cessna Grand Caravan. Photo / Peter de Graaf Five members of the team, himself included, left Northland straight after high school because they didn’t see any opportunities at home. “So having a chance to bring something like this back to Te Tai Tokerau is wonderful for all of us. We’re super passionate about STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) and youth in Northland, and even if we create only one or two jobs, we can expose young Northlanders to this sort of technology.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “The aviation industry has thrived for many, many years through attracting a particular demographic, but the world’s changed and we need people who are interested in different things. Northland and rural New Zealand are full of people who understand hard mahi, who think in different ways, but might not even comprehend that aviation is a career opportunity for them.” Save share Share this article facebook copy link twitter linkedin reddit email Advertisement Advertise with NZME.

The Boston-based startup has won $105 million in fresh funding, impressing big-name investors including the Scottish firm Baillie Gifford with a project to robotize the U.S. Air Force’s workhorse C-130J Super Hercules transport planes that the company is revealing publicly for the first time, as well as its achievement last fall of a key regulatory milestone: New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority approved Merlin’s plan to prove the safety of a single-engine Cessna Caravan cargo plane kitted out with an initial limited autonomy package, making it the first company to win so-called “certification basis” for such a system. Merlin Labs CEO Matthew George says that its initial product will be the first commercially available flight control system that will enable an airplane to automatically follow a programmed path from the taxiway to takeoff to landing, as well as the first featuring an artificial intelligence element: It will be able to understand radio instructions from fast-talking air traffic controllers and follow them. What it won’t be capable of: The company isn’t seeking yet to kit out planes with sensors to automatically detect and avoid obstacles on the ground, like animals or airport vehicles, or other aircraft in the air. A pilot will be required to be onboard to do that, as well as to correct any misunderstandings of air traffic control instructions. That falls a good deal short of the holy grail of full autonomy, but the 32-year-old George says Merlin’s initial system will significantly reduce the workload for pilots, enabling them to act more like safety monitors. It’s part of a calculated strategy by George to devise a product that Merlin can bring to market soon through a regulatory gantlet of aviation safety agencies that are moving cautiously in the face of a startling array of novel aircraft under development, from cargo drones to urban air taxis, some of which are being designed to be fully autonomous from the start , on top of pushing the boundaries with electric propulsion systems and vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. “We think that the hardest problem truly is certification,” George told Forbes . Of Merlin’s roughly 70 employees, about 30 are working on safety certification. That eyebrow-raising share is partly due to the fact that while Merlin is seeking initial air safety approval in New Zealand (the country has an experimentation-friendly regulatory environment that has attracted other cutting-edge aerospace startups that are betting they’ll be able to launch commercial service sooner there, including Boeing-controlled robot air taxi developer Wisk), Merlin is also submitting all stages of its work for simultaneous review by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that it will get a green light in the U.S. as well to market its initial limited autonomy upgrade for the Cessna Caravan. George’s game plan is to start with a revenue-producing cargo service in New Zealand. He thinks that’s a goal Merlin could reach well inside of five years. Merlin Labs CEO Matthew George Courtesy of Merlin Labs In the U.S., Merlin, which was founded in 2017, struck a deal last year to automate 55 twin-engine King Airs operated by Dynamic Aviation – George says an initial use case will be to free up the company’s pilots on fire watch and maritime missions to direct more of their attention to surveillance. He declined to disclose pricing. Merlin also inked a partnership with Ameriflight — the largest U.S. operator of small cargo planes for UPS, FedEx and DHL — which has long struggled to retain pilots intent on moving up to better-paying jobs with the big passenger airlines. Those problems have only worsened over the past year as the airlines have swung from pushing pilots to retire early amid the worst of the pandemic to recruiting feverishly to expand service as travel has rebounded. A retirement wave of Baby Boomers was already expected to fuel a pilot shortfall – CAE estimated in 2020 that 38% of commercial pilots globally were over 50 . Pandemic disruptions have tipped the scales more, including increased volumes of air deliveries of e-commerce orders, further whetting investor interest in Merlin’s B Series fundraising round. George says the company reaped almost double the amount it initially set out to raise. The $105 million round, which boosts Merlin’s total raised to $130 million, was led by Snowpoint Ventures, a private-equity fund focused on dual-use technology that was founded by two current and former Palantir executives, and Baillie Gifford, which until recently has rung up top-tier returns with long-term bets on tech high-flyers like Amazon, Tesla and Netflix. Prior investors including Alphabet’s GV fund also increased their stakes. If safety clearance of Merlin’s initial commercial system takes longer than expected, the company still stands to make money from a contract with the Air Force to automate the flight deck of the C-130J, which George says is worth in the tens of millions of dollars. The goals of the military project mirror the general aspirations for autonomy for large commercial cargo aircraft, and eventually passenger airliners: to go from two pilots to one, and eventually from one to zero. Congress is supportive: In a report on the annual defense budget bill that the House is currently considering, the House Armed Services Committee urges the Department of Defense to use commercial solutions to give its aircraft autonomous capabilities to mitigate the Air Force’s persistent pilot shortage and requests a draft of an implementation plan. The Air Force did not respond to questions from Forbes on the C-130J automation project. Merlin isn’t the only startup working to robotize older aircraft. Competitors include Skyryse, which has pivoted from an initial goal of launching an urban air taxi network to focusing in the short run on simplifying flight controls to cut down on pilot training time ; Xwing, which has built up its own air cargo delivery fleet ; and Reliable Robotics, which has also won Air Force development contracts . In contrast with Merlin, both Xwing and Reliable initially plan to remove the pilot from the cockpit and have remote safety monitors on the ground oversee their aircraft and handle communications with air traffic control. That promises cost savings – one pilot on the ground could eventually oversee multiple aircraft. But George believes that the FAA is wary of the risk of disruptions to communication links between planes and the ground controller, and that Merlin, with its onboard safety pilot, will gain thousands of hours of operating experience before competitors are allowed to take flight. Merlin Labs’ strategy of relying on an onboard pilot to detect and avoid hazards and handle emergency situations “is not bad” to address regulators’ concerns in the short run, says Ella Atkins, director of the University of Michigan’s Autonomous Aerospace Systems Lab, but she says it’s not clear whether the company has a path to full autonomy from the “crawl stage.” And while developing a speech-comprehending AI system to interact with air traffic controllers may make sense now, when the FAA is not yet ready to transition to data link-based methods — which will have to replace voice communications in order to coordinate the large numbers of delivery drones and air taxis that are expected to crowd national airspace in the next few decades — natural language processing is still a difficult problem, Atkins warns, with fast-talking controllers speaking over sometimes static-fuzzed radio connections. “You get to a point where you're 90 plus percent accurate in processing what you've heard, but getting to 100 is extremely hard.” Merlin’s system, which will repeat ATC instructions in a synthesized voice to confirm that it properly heard them, could get stuck in a loop of miscomprehension akin to the old Discover Card commercial in which a customer service agent’s mentions of “fraud protection” are repeatedly misheard by a caller as “frog protection.” “That's kind of the nightmare for natural language processing,” Atkins says, which could end up distracting the air traffic controller as well as the onboard safety pilot. And that’s leaving aside the knotty problem of whether Merlin’s system will reliably translate the instructions into the proper actions, even if it transcribes them word for word. The new fundraising round is going to enable Merlin to hire a lot more people to work on solving those problems. George plans to add another 50 to 60 employees over the next year, taking headcount to 120 to 130. “We’re really excited about what the cash is going to be able to do for us as we continue to innovate here,” he says.

Photo / Peter de Graaf Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson has returned to his Kerikeri roots to set up a world-leading business developing autonomous aircraft — in other words, robot planes. Photo / Peter de Graaf A dream of opening up career opportunities for Northland youth that didn’t exist when he left school has inspired a Kerikeri man to come home and set up a world-leading business developing robot planes. Merlin Labs NZ, the first overseas subsidiary of US aviation technology firm Merlin Labs, opened its brand-new base next to Bay of Islands Airport in Kerikeri on Friday. Shaun Johnson, who joined the Air Force straight out of seventh form at Kerikeri High School, has returned to his old hometown to lead the ground-breaking venture. It would start small as an air freight operation using conventional human-piloted planes and gradually transition to autonomous aircraft which were able to take off, fly and land by themselves. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. In the future the same technology could be applied to reduce crews on bigger planes, he said. In Kerikeri, the firm’s first steps would be to integrate its software and hardware into a fleet of Cessna Caravan planes and to work with New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to certify its systems and make them air-legal. Johnson said the firm would start flying freight in June with an unmodified aircraft between Northland, Auckland and Palmerston North. “We want to demonstrate to the regulator and the public that we’re a capable and reliable freight company before we start introducing new technology. And for ourselves, it’s to get our pilots familiar with the routes we’re going to fly and the avionics in the aircraft because that doesn’t change. We’ll do that for a good year and then start to add our advanced technology as it’s certified,” he said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. At the same time, the company would be carrying out compliance flight testing with the CAA. The goal was to start automated takeoff-to-touchdown flights from the start of 2025, albeit with a human pilot as a backup to make sure everything was functioning as it was supposed to. Ngāti Rēhia’s Kipa Munro offers a blessing while Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson and Merlin Labs chief of staff Dan Rickert place their hands on the company’s soon-to-be autonomous aircraft. Photo / Peter de Graaf There was no timeline as yet for flying without a human pilot on board. “It would be naive to think that all the questions have been answered yet,” he said. “The immediate goals for us are proving our technology in the Caravan, then adding some of those features — which actually are enhancements to safety — to bigger aircraft and growing a deeper understanding of what it means to go from two crew to one and then eventually from one to zero. So New Zealand will become a real test bed for what we do in the future.” Merlin wasn’t the only company developing robot planes but its system was unique in that it could not only take off, join an instrument-flight-rules route and land at the other end, it could also respond to voice commands from air traffic control. Johnson said he didn’t choose Kerikeri only because it was where he grew up. “Honestly, I did look all over the country, and this offers some unique airspace for testing. We’ve got pretty unrestricted airspace up to high altitudes and we have incredible airports with instrument-flight-rules approaches, which we need for our system. We can go between Kerikeri and Kaitāia or Kerikeri and Whangārei in relatively uncongested airspace, and once our product is certified we can head down to Auckland and test our systems in a really congested environment.” The Far North also had the advantages of a supportive council and community, and opportunities to pick up freight runs that wouldn’t interfere with other operators.

The last time he was in the Advocate was when he landed an Iroquois chopper on the field at his old school. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Later he became an engineering officer, completed some tertiary education, and retired as a Wing Commander. He then joined the CAA for six years before he was shoulder-tapped by Merlin to set up the company’s first overseas subsidiary. New Zealand was chosen because of the strong relationship between the CAA and the US Federal Aviation Administration, plus the CAA’s reputation for “being pragmatic, forward-looking yet grounded in safety”. So far Merlin Labs NZ had 15 staff, seven of whom were permanently in Kerikeri. Its second Cessna Caravan arrived yesterday and a third is due late next year. Renata Tane sounds a pūkaea during the blessing of Merlin NZ’s newly delivered Cessna Grand Caravan. Photo / Peter de Graaf Five members of the team, himself included, left Northland straight after high school because they didn’t see any opportunities at home. “So having a chance to bring something like this back to Te Tai Tokerau is wonderful for all of us. We’re super passionate about STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) and youth in Northland, and even if we create only one or two jobs, we can expose young Northlanders to this sort of technology.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “The aviation industry has thrived for many, many years through attracting a particular demographic, but the world’s changed and we need people who are interested in different things. Northland and rural New Zealand are full of people who understand hard mahi, who think in different ways, but might not even comprehend that aviation is a career opportunity for them.” Save share Share this article facebook copy link twitter linkedin reddit email Advertisement Advertise with NZME.

Photo / Peter de Graaf A dream of opening up career opportunities for Northland youth that didn’t exist when he left school has inspired a Kerikeri man to come home and set up a world-leading business developing robot planes. Merlin Labs NZ, the first overseas subsidiary of US aviation technology firm Merlin Labs, opened its brand-new base next to Bay of Islands Airport in Kerikeri on Friday. Shaun Johnson, who joined the Air Force straight out of seventh form at Kerikeri High School, has returned to his old hometown to lead the ground-breaking venture. It would start small as an air freight operation using conventional human-piloted planes and gradually transition to autonomous aircraft which were able to take off, fly and land by themselves.

In Kerikeri, the firm’s first steps would be to integrate its software and hardware into a fleet of Cessna Caravan planes and to work with New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to certify its systems and make them air-legal. Johnson said the firm would start flying freight in June with an unmodified aircraft between Northland, Auckland and Palmerston North. “We want to demonstrate to the regulator and the public that we’re a capable and reliable freight company before we start introducing new technology. And for ourselves, it’s to get our pilots familiar with the routes we’re going to fly and the avionics in the aircraft because that doesn’t change. We’ll do that for a good year and then start to add our advanced technology as it’s certified,” he said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. At the same time, the company would be carrying out compliance flight testing with the CAA. The goal was to start automated takeoff-to-touchdown flights from the start of 2025, albeit with a human pilot as a backup to make sure everything was functioning as it was supposed to. Ngāti Rēhia’s Kipa Munro offers a blessing while Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson and Merlin Labs chief of staff Dan Rickert place their hands on the company’s soon-to-be autonomous aircraft. Photo / Peter de Graaf There was no timeline as yet for flying without a human pilot on board. “It would be naive to think that all the questions have been answered yet,” he said. “The immediate goals for us are proving our technology in the Caravan, then adding some of those features — which actually are enhancements to safety — to bigger aircraft and growing a deeper understanding of what it means to go from two crew to one and then eventually from one to zero. So New Zealand will become a real test bed for what we do in the future.” Merlin wasn’t the only company developing robot planes but its system was unique in that it could not only take off, join an instrument-flight-rules route and land at the other end, it could also respond to voice commands from air traffic control. Johnson said he didn’t choose Kerikeri only because it was where he grew up. “Honestly, I did look all over the country, and this offers some unique airspace for testing. We’ve got pretty unrestricted airspace up to high altitudes and we have incredible airports with instrument-flight-rules approaches, which we need for our system. We can go between Kerikeri and Kaitāia or Kerikeri and Whangārei in relatively uncongested airspace, and once our product is certified we can head down to Auckland and test our systems in a really congested environment.” The Far North also had the advantages of a supportive council and community, and opportunities to pick up freight runs that wouldn’t interfere with other operators.

The last time he was in the Advocate was when he landed an Iroquois chopper on the field at his old school. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Later he became an engineering officer, completed some tertiary education, and retired as a Wing Commander. He then joined the CAA for six years before he was shoulder-tapped by Merlin to set up the company’s first overseas subsidiary. New Zealand was chosen because of the strong relationship between the CAA and the US Federal Aviation Administration, plus the CAA’s reputation for “being pragmatic, forward-looking yet grounded in safety”. So far Merlin Labs NZ had 15 staff, seven of whom were permanently in Kerikeri. Its second Cessna Caravan arrived yesterday and a third is due late next year.

Photo / Peter de Graaf Five members of the team, himself included, left Northland straight after high school because they didn’t see any opportunities at home. “So having a chance to bring something like this back to Te Tai Tokerau is wonderful for all of us. We’re super passionate about STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) and youth in Northland, and even if we create only one or two jobs, we can expose young Northlanders to this sort of technology.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “The aviation industry has thrived for many, many years through attracting a particular demographic, but the world’s changed and we need people who are interested in different things. Northland and rural New Zealand are full of people who understand hard mahi, who think in different ways, but might not even comprehend that aviation is a career opportunity for them.” Save share Share this article facebook copy link twitter linkedin reddit email Advertisement Advertise with NZME.

Got it Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin A s air travelers suffer through a summer of flight delays and cancellations fueled in part by a pilot shortage, Merlin Labs is one of a slew of companies working on a long-term solution: taking pilots out of the cockpit by developing computer systems that allow planes to fly themselves. The Boston-based startup has won $105 million in fresh funding, impressing big-name investors including the Scottish firm Baillie Gifford with a project to robotize the U.S. Air Force’s workhorse C-130J Super Hercules transport planes that the company is revealing publicly for the first time, as well as its achievement last fall of a key regulatory milestone: New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority approved Merlin’s plan to prove the safety of a single-engine Cessna Caravan cargo plane kitted out with an initial limited autonomy package, making it the first company to win so-called “certification basis” for such a system. Merlin Labs CEO Matthew George says that its initial product will be the first commercially available flight control system that will enable an airplane to automatically follow a programmed path from the taxiway to takeoff to landing, as well as the first featuring an artificial intelligence element: It will be able to understand radio instructions from fast-talking air traffic controllers and follow them. What it won’t be capable of: The company isn’t seeking yet to kit out planes with sensors to automatically detect and avoid obstacles on the ground, like animals or airport vehicles, or other aircraft in the air. A pilot will be required to be onboard to do that, as well as to correct any misunderstandings of air traffic control instructions. That falls a good deal short of the holy grail of full autonomy, but the 32-year-old George says Merlin’s initial system will significantly reduce the workload for pilots, enabling them to act more like safety monitors. It’s part of a calculated strategy by George to devise a product that Merlin can bring to market soon through a regulatory gantlet of aviation safety agencies that are moving cautiously in the face of a startling array of novel aircraft under development, from cargo drones to urban air taxis, some of which are being designed to be fully autonomous from the start , on top of pushing the boundaries with electric propulsion systems and vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. “We think that the hardest problem truly is certification,” George told Forbes . Of Merlin’s roughly 70 employees, about 30 are working on safety certification. That eyebrow-raising share is partly due to the fact that while Merlin is seeking initial air safety approval in New Zealand (the country has an experimentation-friendly regulatory environment that has attracted other cutting-edge aerospace startups that are betting they’ll be able to launch commercial service sooner there, including Boeing-controlled robot air taxi developer Wisk), Merlin is also submitting all stages of its work for simultaneous review by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that it will get a green light in the U.S. as well to market its initial limited autonomy upgrade for the Cessna Caravan. George’s game plan is to start with a revenue-producing cargo service in New Zealand. He thinks that’s a goal Merlin could reach well inside of five years. Merlin Labs CEO Matthew George Courtesy of Merlin Labs In the U.S., Merlin, which was founded in 2017, struck a deal last year to automate 55 twin-engine King Airs operated by Dynamic Aviation – George says an initial use case will be to free up the company’s pilots on fire watch and maritime missions to direct more of their attention to surveillance. He declined to disclose pricing. Merlin also inked a partnership with Ameriflight — the largest U.S. operator of small cargo planes for UPS, FedEx and DHL — which has long struggled to retain pilots intent on moving up to better-paying jobs with the big passenger airlines. Those problems have only worsened over the past year as the airlines have swung from pushing pilots to retire early amid the worst of the pandemic to recruiting feverishly to expand service as travel has rebounded. A retirement wave of Baby Boomers was already expected to fuel a pilot shortfall – CAE estimated in 2020 that 38% of commercial pilots globally were over 50 . Pandemic disruptions have tipped the scales more, including increased volumes of air deliveries of e-commerce orders, further whetting investor interest in Merlin’s B Series fundraising round. George says the company reaped almost double the amount it initially set out to raise. The $105 million round, which boosts Merlin’s total raised to $130 million, was led by Snowpoint Ventures, a private-equity fund focused on dual-use technology that was founded by two current and former Palantir executives, and Baillie Gifford, which until recently has rung up top-tier returns with long-term bets on tech high-flyers like Amazon, Tesla and Netflix. Prior investors including Alphabet’s GV fund also increased their stakes. If safety clearance of Merlin’s initial commercial system takes longer than expected, the company still stands to make money from a contract with the Air Force to automate the flight deck of the C-130J, which George says is worth in the tens of millions of dollars. The goals of the military project mirror the general aspirations for autonomy for large commercial cargo aircraft, and eventually passenger airliners: to go from two pilots to one, and eventually from one to zero. Congress is supportive: In a report on the annual defense budget bill that the House is currently considering, the House Armed Services Committee urges the Department of Defense to use commercial solutions to give its aircraft autonomous capabilities to mitigate the Air Force’s persistent pilot shortage and requests a draft of an implementation plan. The Air Force did not respond to questions from Forbes on the C-130J automation project. Merlin isn’t the only startup working to robotize older aircraft. Competitors include Skyryse, which has pivoted from an initial goal of launching an urban air taxi network to focusing in the short run on simplifying flight controls to cut down on pilot training time ; Xwing, which has built up its own air cargo delivery fleet ; and Reliable Robotics, which has also won Air Force development contracts . In contrast with Merlin, both Xwing and Reliable initially plan to remove the pilot from the cockpit and have remote safety monitors on the ground oversee their aircraft and handle communications with air traffic control. That promises cost savings – one pilot on the ground could eventually oversee multiple aircraft. But George believes that the FAA is wary of the risk of disruptions to communication links between planes and the ground controller, and that Merlin, with its onboard safety pilot, will gain thousands of hours of operating experience before competitors are allowed to take flight. Merlin Labs’ strategy of relying on an onboard pilot to detect and avoid hazards and handle emergency situations “is not bad” to address regulators’ concerns in the short run, says Ella Atkins, director of the University of Michigan’s Autonomous Aerospace Systems Lab, but she says it’s not clear whether the company has a path to full autonomy from the “crawl stage.” And while developing a speech-comprehending AI system to interact with air traffic controllers may make sense now, when the FAA is not yet ready to transition to data link-based methods — which will have to replace voice communications in order to coordinate the large numbers of delivery drones and air taxis that are expected to crowd national airspace in the next few decades — natural language processing is still a difficult problem, Atkins warns, with fast-talking controllers speaking over sometimes static-fuzzed radio connections. “You get to a point where you're 90 plus percent accurate in processing what you've heard, but getting to 100 is extremely hard.” Merlin’s system, which will repeat ATC instructions in a synthesized voice to confirm that it properly heard them, could get stuck in a loop of miscomprehension akin to the old Discover Card commercial in which a customer service agent’s mentions of “fraud protection” are repeatedly misheard by a caller as “frog protection.” “That's kind of the nightmare for natural language processing,” Atkins says, which could end up distracting the air traffic controller as well as the onboard safety pilot. And that’s leaving aside the knotty problem of whether Merlin’s system will reliably translate the instructions into the proper actions, even if it transcribes them word for word. The new fundraising round is going to enable Merlin to hire a lot more people to work on solving those problems. George plans to add another 50 to 60 employees over the next year, taking headcount to 120 to 130. “We’re really excited about what the cash is going to be able to do for us as we continue to innovate here,” he says.

Photo / Peter de Graaf Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson has returned to his Kerikeri roots to set up a world-leading business developing autonomous aircraft — in other words, robot planes. Photo / Peter de Graaf A dream of opening up career opportunities for Northland youth that didn’t exist when he left school has inspired a Kerikeri man to come home and set up a world-leading business developing robot planes. Merlin Labs NZ, the first overseas subsidiary of US aviation technology firm Merlin Labs, opened its brand-new base next to Bay of Islands Airport in Kerikeri on Friday. Shaun Johnson, who joined the Air Force straight out of seventh form at Kerikeri High School, has returned to his old hometown to lead the ground-breaking venture. It would start small as an air freight operation using conventional human-piloted planes and gradually transition to autonomous aircraft which were able to take off, fly and land by themselves. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. In the future the same technology could be applied to reduce crews on bigger planes, he said. In Kerikeri, the firm’s first steps would be to integrate its software and hardware into a fleet of Cessna Caravan planes and to work with New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to certify its systems and make them air-legal. Johnson said the firm would start flying freight in June with an unmodified aircraft between Northland, Auckland and Palmerston North. “We want to demonstrate to the regulator and the public that we’re a capable and reliable freight company before we start introducing new technology. And for ourselves, it’s to get our pilots familiar with the routes we’re going to fly and the avionics in the aircraft because that doesn’t change. We’ll do that for a good year and then start to add our advanced technology as it’s certified,” he said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. At the same time, the company would be carrying out compliance flight testing with the CAA. The goal was to start automated takeoff-to-touchdown flights from the start of 2025, albeit with a human pilot as a backup to make sure everything was functioning as it was supposed to. Ngāti Rēhia’s Kipa Munro offers a blessing while Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson and Merlin Labs chief of staff Dan Rickert place their hands on the company’s soon-to-be autonomous aircraft. Photo / Peter de Graaf There was no timeline as yet for flying without a human pilot on board. “It would be naive to think that all the questions have been answered yet,” he said. “The immediate goals for us are proving our technology in the Caravan, then adding some of those features — which actually are enhancements to safety — to bigger aircraft and growing a deeper understanding of what it means to go from two crew to one and then eventually from one to zero. So New Zealand will become a real test bed for what we do in the future.” Merlin wasn’t the only company developing robot planes but its system was unique in that it could not only take off, join an instrument-flight-rules route and land at the other end, it could also respond to voice commands from air traffic control. Johnson said he didn’t choose Kerikeri only because it was where he grew up. “Honestly, I did look all over the country, and this offers some unique airspace for testing. We’ve got pretty unrestricted airspace up to high altitudes and we have incredible airports with instrument-flight-rules approaches, which we need for our system. We can go between Kerikeri and Kaitāia or Kerikeri and Whangārei in relatively uncongested airspace, and once our product is certified we can head down to Auckland and test our systems in a really congested environment.” The Far North also had the advantages of a supportive council and community, and opportunities to pick up freight runs that wouldn’t interfere with other operators.

The last time he was in the Advocate was when he landed an Iroquois chopper on the field at his old school. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Later he became an engineering officer, completed some tertiary education, and retired as a Wing Commander. He then joined the CAA for six years before he was shoulder-tapped by Merlin to set up the company’s first overseas subsidiary. New Zealand was chosen because of the strong relationship between the CAA and the US Federal Aviation Administration, plus the CAA’s reputation for “being pragmatic, forward-looking yet grounded in safety”. So far Merlin Labs NZ had 15 staff, seven of whom were permanently in Kerikeri. Its second Cessna Caravan arrived yesterday and a third is due late next year. Renata Tane sounds a pūkaea during the blessing of Merlin NZ’s newly delivered Cessna Grand Caravan. Photo / Peter de Graaf Five members of the team, himself included, left Northland straight after high school because they didn’t see any opportunities at home. “So having a chance to bring something like this back to Te Tai Tokerau is wonderful for all of us. We’re super passionate about STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) and youth in Northland, and even if we create only one or two jobs, we can expose young Northlanders to this sort of technology.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “The aviation industry has thrived for many, many years through attracting a particular demographic, but the world’s changed and we need people who are interested in different things. Northland and rural New Zealand are full of people who understand hard mahi, who think in different ways, but might not even comprehend that aviation is a career opportunity for them.” Save share Share this article facebook copy link twitter linkedin reddit email Advertisement Advertise with NZME.

You'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account. Got it Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin A s air travelers suffer through a summer of flight delays and cancellations fueled in part by a pilot shortage, Merlin Labs is one of a slew of companies working on a long-term solution: taking pilots out of the cockpit by developing computer systems that allow planes to fly themselves. The Boston-based startup has won $105 million in fresh funding, impressing big-name investors including the Scottish firm Baillie Gifford with a project to robotize the U.S. Air Force’s workhorse C-130J Super Hercules transport planes that the company is revealing publicly for the first time, as well as its achievement last fall of a key regulatory milestone: New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority approved Merlin’s plan to prove the safety of a single-engine Cessna Caravan cargo plane kitted out with an initial limited autonomy package, making it the first company to win so-called “certification basis” for such a system. Merlin Labs CEO Matthew George says that its initial product will be the first commercially available flight control system that will enable an airplane to automatically follow a programmed path from the taxiway to takeoff to landing, as well as the first featuring an artificial intelligence element: It will be able to understand radio instructions from fast-talking air traffic controllers and follow them. What it won’t be capable of: The company isn’t seeking yet to kit out planes with sensors to automatically detect and avoid obstacles on the ground, like animals or airport vehicles, or other aircraft in the air. A pilot will be required to be onboard to do that, as well as to correct any misunderstandings of air traffic control instructions. That falls a good deal short of the holy grail of full autonomy, but the 32-year-old George says Merlin’s initial system will significantly reduce the workload for pilots, enabling them to act more like safety monitors. It’s part of a calculated strategy by George to devise a product that Merlin can bring to market soon through a regulatory gantlet of aviation safety agencies that are moving cautiously in the face of a startling array of novel aircraft under development, from cargo drones to urban air taxis, some of which are being designed to be fully autonomous from the start , on top of pushing the boundaries with electric propulsion systems and vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. “We think that the hardest problem truly is certification,” George told Forbes . Of Merlin’s roughly 70 employees, about 30 are working on safety certification. That eyebrow-raising share is partly due to the fact that while Merlin is seeking initial air safety approval in New Zealand (the country has an experimentation-friendly regulatory environment that has attracted other cutting-edge aerospace startups that are betting they’ll be able to launch commercial service sooner there, including Boeing-controlled robot air taxi developer Wisk), Merlin is also submitting all stages of its work for simultaneous review by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that it will get a green light in the U.S. as well to market its initial limited autonomy upgrade for the Cessna Caravan. George’s game plan is to start with a revenue-producing cargo service in New Zealand. He thinks that’s a goal Merlin could reach well inside of five years. Merlin Labs CEO Matthew George Courtesy of Merlin Labs In the U.S., Merlin, which was founded in 2017, struck a deal last year to automate 55 twin-engine King Airs operated by Dynamic Aviation – George says an initial use case will be to free up the company’s pilots on fire watch and maritime missions to direct more of their attention to surveillance. He declined to disclose pricing. Merlin also inked a partnership with Ameriflight — the largest U.S. operator of small cargo planes for UPS, FedEx and DHL — which has long struggled to retain pilots intent on moving up to better-paying jobs with the big passenger airlines. Those problems have only worsened over the past year as the airlines have swung from pushing pilots to retire early amid the worst of the pandemic to recruiting feverishly to expand service as travel has rebounded. A retirement wave of Baby Boomers was already expected to fuel a pilot shortfall – CAE estimated in 2020 that 38% of commercial pilots globally were over 50 . Pandemic disruptions have tipped the scales more, including increased volumes of air deliveries of e-commerce orders, further whetting investor interest in Merlin’s B Series fundraising round. George says the company reaped almost double the amount it initially set out to raise. The $105 million round, which boosts Merlin’s total raised to $130 million, was led by Snowpoint Ventures, a private-equity fund focused on dual-use technology that was founded by two current and former Palantir executives, and Baillie Gifford, which until recently has rung up top-tier returns with long-term bets on tech high-flyers like Amazon, Tesla and Netflix. Prior investors including Alphabet’s GV fund also increased their stakes. If safety clearance of Merlin’s initial commercial system takes longer than expected, the company still stands to make money from a contract with the Air Force to automate the flight deck of the C-130J, which George says is worth in the tens of millions of dollars. The goals of the military project mirror the general aspirations for autonomy for large commercial cargo aircraft, and eventually passenger airliners: to go from two pilots to one, and eventually from one to zero. Congress is supportive: In a report on the annual defense budget bill that the House is currently considering, the House Armed Services Committee urges the Department of Defense to use commercial solutions to give its aircraft autonomous capabilities to mitigate the Air Force’s persistent pilot shortage and requests a draft of an implementation plan. The Air Force did not respond to questions from Forbes on the C-130J automation project. Merlin isn’t the only startup working to robotize older aircraft. Competitors include Skyryse, which has pivoted from an initial goal of launching an urban air taxi network to focusing in the short run on simplifying flight controls to cut down on pilot training time ; Xwing, which has built up its own air cargo delivery fleet ; and Reliable Robotics, which has also won Air Force development contracts . In contrast with Merlin, both Xwing and Reliable initially plan to remove the pilot from the cockpit and have remote safety monitors on the ground oversee their aircraft and handle communications with air traffic control. That promises cost savings – one pilot on the ground could eventually oversee multiple aircraft. But George believes that the FAA is wary of the risk of disruptions to communication links between planes and the ground controller, and that Merlin, with its onboard safety pilot, will gain thousands of hours of operating experience before competitors are allowed to take flight. Merlin Labs’ strategy of relying on an onboard pilot to detect and avoid hazards and handle emergency situations “is not bad” to address regulators’ concerns in the short run, says Ella Atkins, director of the University of Michigan’s Autonomous Aerospace Systems Lab, but she says it’s not clear whether the company has a path to full autonomy from the “crawl stage.” And while developing a speech-comprehending AI system to interact with air traffic controllers may make sense now, when the FAA is not yet ready to transition to data link-based methods — which will have to replace voice communications in order to coordinate the large numbers of delivery drones and air taxis that are expected to crowd national airspace in the next few decades — natural language processing is still a difficult problem, Atkins warns, with fast-talking controllers speaking over sometimes static-fuzzed radio connections. “You get to a point where you're 90 plus percent accurate in processing what you've heard, but getting to 100 is extremely hard.” Merlin’s system, which will repeat ATC instructions in a synthesized voice to confirm that it properly heard them, could get stuck in a loop of miscomprehension akin to the old Discover Card commercial in which a customer service agent’s mentions of “fraud protection” are repeatedly misheard by a caller as “frog protection.” “That's kind of the nightmare for natural language processing,” Atkins says, which could end up distracting the air traffic controller as well as the onboard safety pilot. And that’s leaving aside the knotty problem of whether Merlin’s system will reliably translate the instructions into the proper actions, even if it transcribes them word for word. The new fundraising round is going to enable Merlin to hire a lot more people to work on solving those problems. George plans to add another 50 to 60 employees over the next year, taking headcount to 120 to 130. “We’re really excited about what the cash is going to be able to do for us as we continue to innovate here,” he says.

Photo / Peter de Graaf Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson has returned to his Kerikeri roots to set up a world-leading business developing autonomous aircraft — in other words, robot planes. Photo / Peter de Graaf A dream of opening up career opportunities for Northland youth that didn’t exist when he left school has inspired a Kerikeri man to come home and set up a world-leading business developing robot planes. Merlin Labs NZ, the first overseas subsidiary of US aviation technology firm Merlin Labs, opened its brand-new base next to Bay of Islands Airport in Kerikeri on Friday. Shaun Johnson, who joined the Air Force straight out of seventh form at Kerikeri High School, has returned to his old hometown to lead the ground-breaking venture. It would start small as an air freight operation using conventional human-piloted planes and gradually transition to autonomous aircraft which were able to take off, fly and land by themselves. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. In the future the same technology could be applied to reduce crews on bigger planes, he said. In Kerikeri, the firm’s first steps would be to integrate its software and hardware into a fleet of Cessna Caravan planes and to work with New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to certify its systems and make them air-legal. Johnson said the firm would start flying freight in June with an unmodified aircraft between Northland, Auckland and Palmerston North. “We want to demonstrate to the regulator and the public that we’re a capable and reliable freight company before we start introducing new technology. And for ourselves, it’s to get our pilots familiar with the routes we’re going to fly and the avionics in the aircraft because that doesn’t change. We’ll do that for a good year and then start to add our advanced technology as it’s certified,” he said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. At the same time, the company would be carrying out compliance flight testing with the CAA. The goal was to start automated takeoff-to-touchdown flights from the start of 2025, albeit with a human pilot as a backup to make sure everything was functioning as it was supposed to. Ngāti Rēhia’s Kipa Munro offers a blessing while Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson and Merlin Labs chief of staff Dan Rickert place their hands on the company’s soon-to-be autonomous aircraft. Photo / Peter de Graaf There was no timeline as yet for flying without a human pilot on board. “It would be naive to think that all the questions have been answered yet,” he said. “The immediate goals for us are proving our technology in the Caravan, then adding some of those features — which actually are enhancements to safety — to bigger aircraft and growing a deeper understanding of what it means to go from two crew to one and then eventually from one to zero. So New Zealand will become a real test bed for what we do in the future.” Merlin wasn’t the only company developing robot planes but its system was unique in that it could not only take off, join an instrument-flight-rules route and land at the other end, it could also respond to voice commands from air traffic control. Johnson said he didn’t choose Kerikeri only because it was where he grew up. “Honestly, I did look all over the country, and this offers some unique airspace for testing. We’ve got pretty unrestricted airspace up to high altitudes and we have incredible airports with instrument-flight-rules approaches, which we need for our system. We can go between Kerikeri and Kaitāia or Kerikeri and Whangārei in relatively uncongested airspace, and once our product is certified we can head down to Auckland and test our systems in a really congested environment.” The Far North also had the advantages of a supportive council and community, and opportunities to pick up freight runs that wouldn’t interfere with other operators.

The last time he was in the Advocate was when he landed an Iroquois chopper on the field at his old school. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Later he became an engineering officer, completed some tertiary education, and retired as a Wing Commander. He then joined the CAA for six years before he was shoulder-tapped by Merlin to set up the company’s first overseas subsidiary. New Zealand was chosen because of the strong relationship between the CAA and the US Federal Aviation Administration, plus the CAA’s reputation for “being pragmatic, forward-looking yet grounded in safety”. So far Merlin Labs NZ had 15 staff, seven of whom were permanently in Kerikeri. Its second Cessna Caravan arrived yesterday and a third is due late next year. Renata Tane sounds a pūkaea during the blessing of Merlin NZ’s newly delivered Cessna Grand Caravan. Photo / Peter de Graaf Five members of the team, himself included, left Northland straight after high school because they didn’t see any opportunities at home. “So having a chance to bring something like this back to Te Tai Tokerau is wonderful for all of us. We’re super passionate about STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) and youth in Northland, and even if we create only one or two jobs, we can expose young Northlanders to this sort of technology.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “The aviation industry has thrived for many, many years through attracting a particular demographic, but the world’s changed and we need people who are interested in different things. Northland and rural New Zealand are full of people who understand hard mahi, who think in different ways, but might not even comprehend that aviation is a career opportunity for them.” Save share Share this article facebook copy link twitter linkedin reddit email Advertisement Advertise with NZME.

Got it Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin A s air travelers suffer through a summer of flight delays and cancellations fueled in part by a pilot shortage, Merlin Labs is one of a slew of companies working on a long-term solution: taking pilots out of the cockpit by developing computer systems that allow planes to fly themselves. The Boston-based startup has won $105 million in fresh funding, impressing big-name investors including the Scottish firm Baillie Gifford with a project to robotize the U.S. Air Force’s workhorse C-130J Super Hercules transport planes that the company is revealing publicly for the first time, as well as its achievement last fall of a key regulatory milestone: New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority approved Merlin’s plan to prove the safety of a single-engine Cessna Caravan cargo plane kitted out with an initial limited autonomy package, making it the first company to win so-called “certification basis” for such a system. Merlin Labs CEO Matthew George says that its initial product will be the first commercially available flight control system that will enable an airplane to automatically follow a programmed path from the taxiway to takeoff to landing, as well as the first featuring an artificial intelligence element: It will be able to understand radio instructions from fast-talking air traffic controllers and follow them. What it won’t be capable of: The company isn’t seeking yet to kit out planes with sensors to automatically detect and avoid obstacles on the ground, like animals or airport vehicles, or other aircraft in the air. A pilot will be required to be onboard to do that, as well as to correct any misunderstandings of air traffic control instructions. That falls a good deal short of the holy grail of full autonomy, but the 32-year-old George says Merlin’s initial system will significantly reduce the workload for pilots, enabling them to act more like safety monitors. It’s part of a calculated strategy by George to devise a product that Merlin can bring to market soon through a regulatory gantlet of aviation safety agencies that are moving cautiously in the face of a startling array of novel aircraft under development, from cargo drones to urban air taxis, some of which are being designed to be fully autonomous from the start , on top of pushing the boundaries with electric propulsion systems and vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. “We think that the hardest problem truly is certification,” George told Forbes . Of Merlin’s roughly 70 employees, about 30 are working on safety certification. That eyebrow-raising share is partly due to the fact that while Merlin is seeking initial air safety approval in New Zealand (the country has an experimentation-friendly regulatory environment that has attracted other cutting-edge aerospace startups that are betting they’ll be able to launch commercial service sooner there, including Boeing-controlled robot air taxi developer Wisk), Merlin is also submitting all stages of its work for simultaneous review by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that it will get a green light in the U.S. as well to market its initial limited autonomy upgrade for the Cessna Caravan. George’s game plan is to start with a revenue-producing cargo service in New Zealand. He thinks that’s a goal Merlin could reach well inside of five years. Merlin Labs CEO Matthew George Courtesy of Merlin Labs In the U.S., Merlin, which was founded in 2017, struck a deal last year to automate 55 twin-engine King Airs operated by Dynamic Aviation – George says an initial use case will be to free up the company’s pilots on fire watch and maritime missions to direct more of their attention to surveillance. He declined to disclose pricing. Merlin also inked a partnership with Ameriflight — the largest U.S. operator of small cargo planes for UPS, FedEx and DHL — which has long struggled to retain pilots intent on moving up to better-paying jobs with the big passenger airlines. Those problems have only worsened over the past year as the airlines have swung from pushing pilots to retire early amid the worst of the pandemic to recruiting feverishly to expand service as travel has rebounded. A retirement wave of Baby Boomers was already expected to fuel a pilot shortfall – CAE estimated in 2020 that 38% of commercial pilots globally were over 50 . Pandemic disruptions have tipped the scales more, including increased volumes of air deliveries of e-commerce orders, further whetting investor interest in Merlin’s B Series fundraising round. George says the company reaped almost double the amount it initially set out to raise. The $105 million round, which boosts Merlin’s total raised to $130 million, was led by Snowpoint Ventures, a private-equity fund focused on dual-use technology that was founded by two current and former Palantir executives, and Baillie Gifford, which until recently has rung up top-tier returns with long-term bets on tech high-flyers like Amazon, Tesla and Netflix. Prior investors including Alphabet’s GV fund also increased their stakes. If safety clearance of Merlin’s initial commercial system takes longer than expected, the company still stands to make money from a contract with the Air Force to automate the flight deck of the C-130J, which George says is worth in the tens of millions of dollars. The goals of the military project mirror the general aspirations for autonomy for large commercial cargo aircraft, and eventually passenger airliners: to go from two pilots to one, and eventually from one to zero. Congress is supportive: In a report on the annual defense budget bill that the House is currently considering, the House Armed Services Committee urges the Department of Defense to use commercial solutions to give its aircraft autonomous capabilities to mitigate the Air Force’s persistent pilot shortage and requests a draft of an implementation plan. The Air Force did not respond to questions from Forbes on the C-130J automation project. Merlin isn’t the only startup working to robotize older aircraft. Competitors include Skyryse, which has pivoted from an initial goal of launching an urban air taxi network to focusing in the short run on simplifying flight controls to cut down on pilot training time ; Xwing, which has built up its own air cargo delivery fleet ; and Reliable Robotics, which has also won Air Force development contracts . In contrast with Merlin, both Xwing and Reliable initially plan to remove the pilot from the cockpit and have remote safety monitors on the ground oversee their aircraft and handle communications with air traffic control. That promises cost savings – one pilot on the ground could eventually oversee multiple aircraft. But George believes that the FAA is wary of the risk of disruptions to communication links between planes and the ground controller, and that Merlin, with its onboard safety pilot, will gain thousands of hours of operating experience before competitors are allowed to take flight. Merlin Labs’ strategy of relying on an onboard pilot to detect and avoid hazards and handle emergency situations “is not bad” to address regulators’ concerns in the short run, says Ella Atkins, director of the University of Michigan’s Autonomous Aerospace Systems Lab, but she says it’s not clear whether the company has a path to full autonomy from the “crawl stage.” And while developing a speech-comprehending AI system to interact with air traffic controllers may make sense now, when the FAA is not yet ready to transition to data link-based methods — which will have to replace voice communications in order to coordinate the large numbers of delivery drones and air taxis that are expected to crowd national airspace in the next few decades — natural language processing is still a difficult problem, Atkins warns, with fast-talking controllers speaking over sometimes static-fuzzed radio connections. “You get to a point where you're 90 plus percent accurate in processing what you've heard, but getting to 100 is extremely hard.” Merlin’s system, which will repeat ATC instructions in a synthesized voice to confirm that it properly heard them, could get stuck in a loop of miscomprehension akin to the old Discover Card commercial in which a customer service agent’s mentions of “fraud protection” are repeatedly misheard by a caller as “frog protection.” “That's kind of the nightmare for natural language processing,” Atkins says, which could end up distracting the air traffic controller as well as the onboard safety pilot. And that’s leaving aside the knotty problem of whether Merlin’s system will reliably translate the instructions into the proper actions, even if it transcribes them word for word. The new fundraising round is going to enable Merlin to hire a lot more people to work on solving those problems. George plans to add another 50 to 60 employees over the next year, taking headcount to 120 to 130. “We’re really excited about what the cash is going to be able to do for us as we continue to innovate here,” he says.

Photo / Peter de Graaf Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson has returned to his Kerikeri roots to set up a world-leading business developing autonomous aircraft — in other words, robot planes. Photo / Peter de Graaf A dream of opening up career opportunities for Northland youth that didn’t exist when he left school has inspired a Kerikeri man to come home and set up a world-leading business developing robot planes. Merlin Labs NZ, the first overseas subsidiary of US aviation technology firm Merlin Labs, opened its brand-new base next to Bay of Islands Airport in Kerikeri on Friday. Shaun Johnson, who joined the Air Force straight out of seventh form at Kerikeri High School, has returned to his old hometown to lead the ground-breaking venture. It would start small as an air freight operation using conventional human-piloted planes and gradually transition to autonomous aircraft which were able to take off, fly and land by themselves. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. In the future the same technology could be applied to reduce crews on bigger planes, he said. In Kerikeri, the firm’s first steps would be to integrate its software and hardware into a fleet of Cessna Caravan planes and to work with New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to certify its systems and make them air-legal. Johnson said the firm would start flying freight in June with an unmodified aircraft between Northland, Auckland and Palmerston North. “We want to demonstrate to the regulator and the public that we’re a capable and reliable freight company before we start introducing new technology. And for ourselves, it’s to get our pilots familiar with the routes we’re going to fly and the avionics in the aircraft because that doesn’t change. We’ll do that for a good year and then start to add our advanced technology as it’s certified,” he said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. At the same time, the company would be carrying out compliance flight testing with the CAA. The goal was to start automated takeoff-to-touchdown flights from the start of 2025, albeit with a human pilot as a backup to make sure everything was functioning as it was supposed to. Ngāti Rēhia’s Kipa Munro offers a blessing while Merlin Labs NZ chief executive Shaun Johnson and Merlin Labs chief of staff Dan Rickert place their hands on the company’s soon-to-be autonomous aircraft.

So New Zealand will become a real test bed for what we do in the future.” Merlin wasn’t the only company developing robot planes but its system was unique in that it could not only take off, join an instrument-flight-rules route and land at the other end, it could also respond to voice commands from air traffic control. Johnson said he didn’t choose Kerikeri only because it was where he grew up. “Honestly, I did look all over the country, and this offers some unique airspace for testing. We’ve got pretty unrestricted airspace up to high altitudes and we have incredible airports with instrument-flight-rules approaches, which we need for our system. We can go between Kerikeri and Kaitāia or Kerikeri and Whangārei in relatively uncongested airspace, and once our product is certified we can head down to Auckland and test our systems in a really congested environment.” The Far North also had the advantages of a supportive council and community, and opportunities to pick up freight runs that wouldn’t interfere with other operators.

The last time he was in the Advocate was when he landed an Iroquois chopper on the field at his old school. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Later he became an engineering officer, completed some tertiary education, and retired as a Wing Commander. He then joined the CAA for six years before he was shoulder-tapped by Merlin to set up the company’s first overseas subsidiary. New Zealand was chosen because of the strong relationship between the CAA and the US Federal Aviation Administration, plus the CAA’s reputation for “being pragmatic, forward-looking yet grounded in safety”. So far Merlin Labs NZ had 15 staff, seven of whom were permanently in Kerikeri. Its second Cessna Caravan arrived yesterday and a third is due late next year.

We’re super passionate about STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) and youth in Northland, and even if we create only one or two jobs, we can expose young Northlanders to this sort of technology.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “The aviation industry has thrived for many, many years through attracting a particular demographic, but the world’s changed and we need people who are interested in different things. Northland and rural New Zealand are full of people who understand hard mahi, who think in different ways, but might not even comprehend that aviation is a career opportunity for them.” Save share Share this article facebook copy link twitter linkedin reddit email Advertisement Advertise with NZME.

You'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account. Got it Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin A s air travelers suffer through a summer of flight delays and cancellations fueled in part by a pilot shortage, Merlin Labs is one of a slew of companies working on a long-term solution: taking pilots out of the cockpit by developing computer systems that allow planes to fly themselves. The Boston-based startup has won $105 million in fresh funding, impressing big-name investors including the Scottish firm Baillie Gifford with a project to robotize the U.S. Air Force’s workhorse C-130J Super Hercules transport planes that the company is revealing publicly for the first time, as well as its achievement last fall of a key regulatory milestone: New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority approved Merlin’s plan to prove the safety of a single-engine Cessna Caravan cargo plane kitted out with an initial limited autonomy package, making it the first company to win so-called “certification basis” for such a system. Merlin Labs CEO Matthew George says that its initial product will be the first commercially available flight control system that will enable an airplane to automatically follow a programmed path from the taxiway to takeoff to landing, as well as the first featuring an artificial intelligence element: It will be able to understand radio instructions from fast-talking air traffic controllers and follow them. What it won’t be capable of: The company isn’t seeking yet to kit out planes with sensors to automatically detect and avoid obstacles on the ground, like animals or airport vehicles, or other aircraft in the air. A pilot will be required to be onboard to do that, as well as to correct any misunderstandings of air traffic control instructions. That falls a good deal short of the holy grail of full autonomy, but the 32-year-old George says Merlin’s initial system will significantly reduce the workload for pilots, enabling them to act more like safety monitors. It’s part of a calculated strategy by George to devise a product that Merlin can bring to market soon through a regulatory gantlet of aviation safety agencies that are moving cautiously in the face of a startling array of novel aircraft under development, from cargo drones to urban air taxis, some of which are being designed to be fully autonomous from the start , on top of pushing the boundaries with electric propulsion systems and vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. “We think that the hardest problem truly is certification,” George told Forbes . Of Merlin’s roughly 70 employees, about 30 are working on safety certification. That eyebrow-raising share is partly due to the fact that while Merlin is seeking initial air safety approval in New Zealand (the country has an experimentation-friendly regulatory environment that has attracted other cutting-edge aerospace startups that are betting they’ll be able to launch commercial service sooner there, including Boeing-controlled robot air taxi developer Wisk), Merlin is also submitting all stages of its work for simultaneous review by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that it will get a green light in the U.S. as well to market its initial limited autonomy upgrade for the Cessna Caravan. George’s game plan is to start with a revenue-producing cargo service in New Zealand. He thinks that’s a goal Merlin could reach well inside of five years. Merlin Labs CEO Matthew George Courtesy of Merlin Labs In the U.S., Merlin, which was founded in 2017, struck a deal last year to automate 55 twin-engine King Airs operated by Dynamic Aviation – George says an initial use case will be to free up the company’s pilots on fire watch and maritime missions to direct more of their attention to surveillance. He declined to disclose pricing. Merlin also inked a partnership with Ameriflight — the largest U.S. operator of small cargo planes for UPS, FedEx and DHL — which has long struggled to retain pilots intent on moving up to better-paying jobs with the big passenger airlines. Those problems have only worsened over the past year as the airlines have swung from pushing pilots to retire early amid the worst of the pandemic to recruiting feverishly to expand service as travel has rebounded. A retirement wave of Baby Boomers was already expected to fuel a pilot shortfall – CAE estimated in 2020 that 38% of commercial pilots globally were over 50 . Pandemic disruptions have tipped the scales more, including increased volumes of air deliveries of e-commerce orders, further whetting investor interest in Merlin’s B Series fundraising round. George says the company reaped almost double the amount it initially set out to raise. The $105 million round, which boosts Merlin’s total raised to $130 million, was led by Snowpoint Ventures, a private-equity fund focused on dual-use technology that was founded by two current and former Palantir executives, and Baillie Gifford, which until recently has rung up top-tier returns with long-term bets on tech high-flyers like Amazon, Tesla and Netflix. Prior investors including Alphabet’s GV fund also increased their stakes. If safety clearance of Merlin’s initial commercial system takes longer than expected, the company still stands to make money from a contract with the Air Force to automate the flight deck of the C-130J, which George says is worth in the tens of millions of dollars. The goals of the military project mirror the general aspirations for autonomy for large commercial cargo aircraft, and eventually passenger airliners: to go from two pilots to one, and eventually from one to zero. Congress is supportive: In a report on the annual defense budget bill that the House is currently considering, the House Armed Services Committee urges the Department of Defense to use commercial solutions to give its aircraft autonomous capabilities to mitigate the Air Force’s persistent pilot shortage and requests a draft of an implementation plan. The Air Force did not respond to questions from Forbes on the C-130J automation project. Merlin isn’t the only startup working to robotize older aircraft. Competitors include Skyryse, which has pivoted from an initial goal of launching an urban air taxi network to focusing in the short run on simplifying flight controls to cut down on pilot training time ; Xwing, which has built up its own air cargo delivery fleet ; and Reliable Robotics, which has also won Air Force development contracts . In contrast with Merlin, both Xwing and Reliable initially plan to remove the pilot from the cockpit and have remote safety monitors on the ground oversee their aircraft and handle communications with air traffic control. That promises cost savings – one pilot on the ground could eventually oversee multiple aircraft. But George believes that the FAA is wary of the risk of disruptions to communication links between planes and the ground controller, and that Merlin, with its onboard safety pilot, will gain thousands of hours of operating experience before competitors are allowed to take flight. Merlin Labs’ strategy of relying on an onboard pilot to detect and avoid hazards and handle emergency situations “is not bad” to address regulators’ concerns in the short run, says Ella Atkins, director of the University of Michigan’s Autonomous Aerospace Systems Lab, but she says it’s not clear whether the company has a path to full autonomy from the “crawl stage.” And while developing a speech-comprehending AI system to interact with air traffic controllers may make sense now, when the FAA is not yet ready to transition to data link-based methods — which will have to replace voice communications in order to coordinate the large numbers of delivery drones and air taxis that are expected to crowd national airspace in the next few decades — natural language processing is still a difficult problem, Atkins warns, with fast-talking controllers speaking over sometimes static-fuzzed radio connections. “You get to a point where you're 90 plus percent accurate in processing what you've heard, but getting to 100 is extremely hard.” Merlin’s system, which will repeat ATC instructions in a synthesized voice to confirm that it properly heard them, could get stuck in a loop of miscomprehension akin to the old Discover Card commercial in which a customer service agent’s mentions of “fraud protection” are repeatedly misheard by a caller as “frog protection.” “That's kind of the nightmare for natural language processing,” Atkins says, which could end up distracting the air traffic controller as well as the onboard safety pilot. And that’s leaving aside the knotty problem of whether Merlin’s system will reliably translate the instructions into the proper actions, even if it transcribes them word for word. The new fundraising round is going to enable Merlin to hire a lot more people to work on solving those problems. George plans to add another 50 to 60 employees over the next year, taking headcount to 120 to 130. “We’re really excited about what the cash is going to be able to do for us as we continue to innovate here,” he says.
