""...a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus...""

So, the lock-up period starts on the date of the prospectus, which is not specified in this particular document. However, we can infer that it is likely to be a specific date sometime in the future.

If you're looking for a specific date, I'd recommend checking the filing date of the prospectus or searching for the relevant filings with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) to determine when the lock-up period actually began."
