To cut a long story short, I was looking at investing $50,000 USD in Ripple Labs at this stage which could be increased later the reason for this amount is the Tax implications for NZ investors investing overseas within a financial year.. . Could you let me know if $50,000 USD investments in Ripple Labs are still an option and what the fee structure would be, depending on that it may be possible to make the investment in the near future.. . Thank you for your time in advance. . Kind regards Blair McKinnon,  Hi Meg. . Hope things are going well.  Just checking if all information was correct that I entered and if there are any offers on Ripple for my $50,000 option.. . Kind regards Blair,  Hi Meg. . Thank you for your email.  I do appreciate you getting back to me. For the New Zealand Tax situation it would be prohibitive to purchase above 50,000 USD , the only way I can see around this is me personally looking for another investor in NZ who would be in partnership. I will ask some others that I know to see if anyone is interested. . . Can I ask if a 50,000 USD option is likely to come up in up near future ? Or is this option unlikely ?. . Thank you again for your time.. . Kind regards Blair,  Hi Meg. . Just getting back with regards to perhaps finding a partnership buy of the 100,000 USD, unfortunately the people I know really don't understand the Crypto industry and are hesitant to invest in the area. I guess we just need to wait and see if a 50,000 option becomes available. . Kind regards Blair,  Hi Meg. . Thank you for your email.  Yes I would like to accept the offer.  What do you need to move forward. . Kind regards Blair,  Hi Meg. . Thank you for your email.  The FX Conversion from NZD to USD has now gone through so the transaction should be faster now.

Here is my \Big Ask\, is there a way I could purchase 50k of Anthropic this one time that will replace what EquityZen was unable to deliver. . Their notification states: . \This investment opportunity was part of an auction process led by Parella Weinberg. Unfortunately, we have been notified that EquityZen funds will not be allocated in the auction at this time. This is a disappointing outcome which, as we understand it, is the result of two factors â€“ the auction was oversubscribed and Anthropic used its right to approve each bidder to prioritize strategic investors, existing investors, and institutional investors. If we are notified of any changes in the allocation process and an opportunity becomes available, we will reach out to you. EquityZen will return all funds to investors on Thursday and Friday, May 30 - 31. Funds will be redeposited from account it had been taken out.\. . Austin, is there a way I can purchase 50k of Anthropic with FORGE from my Rocket Dollar retirement account that SpaceX was funded from? And if there are zero creative options, I can access an additional 50k by the end of this month, if that is the only option purchasing Anthropic. Can a single investment be funded from two different types of accounts, such as retirement and personal?. . And where is Nick Gonzaga!? What a nice person, we have been keeping in touch after the SpaceX transaction. He seems to be doing well at his new place of employment..  . Thank you so Austin for any help you can offer. .

"Hi, Mr. Kalavres,. . Please give me a call to discuss selling my shares of a company called nGap Inc. They are based in Bonsall, CA and have offices in Las Vegas, NV. I have roughly 200,000 shares; roughly half of those are common, and half are preferred. They have created a software system that aims to connect defense contractors with sellers of material goods, kind of like an Amazon or EBay for defense requisitioning, with all of the Pentagon's special forms and requirements built into their system. Based on the claims in their \investor updates,\ they appear to be making great inroads, and on the verge of large contracts with various DoD entities. I can forward you the investor updates, of course. I do not know how to research their claims.. . As for me, I just turned 65 and I am retiring to a place called Tagaytay in the Philippines. I am a retired ship's officer, I have a YouTube page called \The Tall Tagaytay Guy.\ You can see me there in my full captain's regalia, and my (admittedly feeble) first effort at a video. . . As mentioned, I am retiring and I would like to sell some or all of my stock. Ideally I would like to sell $250,000 dollars' worth, enough to move my things to the Philippines and buy some land and build a house. Ideally I would like to sell just enough of my stock to cover the 250k and hang on to the rest. I believe in nGap, but I have just run out of time...my tickets to fly to Manila are for November 4th. But I *would* be willing to sell all my shares, if the price was right.. . I am NOT a \sophisticated investor\ under the definitions; I should never have been sold the stock in the first place. But I have an attorney friend, Michael McDonnell, who has practiced securities law before the US Supreme Court, who will be negotiating for me, and just generally keeping me from running afoul of securities laws. His number is 619-322-8008. He is in San Diego, CA, with me. He is currently on vacation until the end of May. So ideally, I would like to do what I can starting next week, in preparation for his arrival at the end of this month.. . Please call me at your earliest convenience at 619-993-9800...I am working tomorrow morning (Friday the 24th) But I can field a phone call while I am working...If I can't speak with you right that moment, we can set up an appointment.. .

Charles Shwabb received it as â€œcoveredâ€ from TD Ameritrade at 24 cents per share even though I purchased it at $31 and $35 pre-ipo. . . I was taxed on a $125,000 gain after I sold 3811 shares. I only made ~$4,000 from the shares I sold, Iâ€™m still holding ~600 shares. I never made $125,000. . . If TDA never received transfer reports from you then why/how did they go ahead and change the cost basis number on their own? Thatâ€™s illegal and now they wonâ€™t change it back to the correct amount even after I sent over my forge global documents. . . I need this to be resolved ASAP. Thank you for your time and help.. .

"The propellantless propulsion technology developed by . . Quantum Dynamics Enterprises, Inc., represents a significant advancement in the field of space travel. Unlike traditional propulsion methods that rely on the expulsion of mass (propellant), this cutting-edge technology enables spacecraft to achieve propulsion without the need for conventional fuel sources.. . Key Features of the CID (Centrifugal Impulse Drive) Technology:. 1. Innovative Propulsion Mechanism: Using photovoltaic cells to charge batteries, electricity is converted directly into thrust, with no ejection of mass.. . 2. Increased Efficiency, Sustainability, and Cost Savings: This new propellantless propulsion technology will allow satellites and other spacecraft to remain in orbit for longer periods, thereby decreasing the need to deorbit satellites and other spacecraft because they have run out of fuel, resulting in major savings by decreasing the number of launches.. . 3. Live Demonstration at SpaceCom Expo: CID will be suspended on a torsion balance and will demonstrate unidirectional thrust. Guests will be allowed to completely examine CID.. . â€œWe are thrilled to showcase our propellantless propulsion technology at SpaceCom Expo,â€ said Harry Sprain, CEO, of Quantum Dynamics Enterprises, Inc. â€œThis innovation will redefine the future of space exploration by offering a more efficient and sustainable means of propulsion for all spacecraft.â€. .

"I have about 150,000 unexercised options in Scale AI I'd be interested to sell. Based on the \Last Closed Date\ price on Forge, shares sold for $9.55 a share in December. I am still figuring out tax implications and personal goals to decide if I want to just sell everything now, or if we want to sell a portion now, and exercise the rest to sell next year and get the tax benefits of long-term capital gains.. . Long story short -- I'm interested in selling either 50,000 shares now and 100,000 shares next year, or selling all 150,000 shares now. I'm assuming that Forge showing a \last closed date\ means that people are able to have deals approved with Scale's board (this was an area of uncertainty when I looked into this a year or so ago). What does the process look like for doing this through Forge? I assume that I would have to exercise options before the sale is closed, but I don't have cash on hand to exercise 50,000 options.
